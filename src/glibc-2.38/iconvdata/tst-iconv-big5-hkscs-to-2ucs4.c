/* A few BIG5-HKSCS characters map in two unicode code points.
   They are:
   /x88/x62 => <U00CA><U0304>
   /x88/x64 => <U00CA><U030C>
   /x88/xa3 => <U00EA><U0304>
   /x88/xa5 => <U00EA><U030C>
   Each of these is special cased in iconvdata/big5hkscs.c.
   This test ensures that we correctly reset the shift state after
   outputting any of these characters.  We do this by converting
   each them followed by converting an ASCII character.  If we fail
   to reset the shift state (bug 25734) then we'll see the last
   character in the queue output again.  */
