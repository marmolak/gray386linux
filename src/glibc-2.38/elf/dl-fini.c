     loaded objects, in all namespaces.  The problem is that the ELF
     specification now demands that dependencies between the modules
     are taken into account.  I.e., the destructor for a module is
     called before the ones for any of its dependencies.

     To make things more complicated, we cannot simply use the reverse
     order of the constructors.  Since the user might have loaded objects
     using `dlopen' there are possibly several other modules with its
     dependencies to be taken into account.  Therefore we have to start
     determining the order of the modules once again from the beginning.  */
