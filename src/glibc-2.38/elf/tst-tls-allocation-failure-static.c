/* The test actual binary is patched using scripts/tst-elf-edit.py
   --maximize-tls-size, and this introduces the expected test
   allocation failure due to an excessive PT_LS p_memsz value.

   Patching the binary is required because on some 64-bit targets, TLS
   relocations can only cover a 32-bit range, and glibc-internal TLS
   variables such as errno end up outside that range.  */
