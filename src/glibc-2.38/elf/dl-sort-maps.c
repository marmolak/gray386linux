     which is a topological sort.

     We go from maps[nmaps - 1] backwards towards maps[0] at this level.
     Due to the breadth-first search (BFS) ordering we receive, going
     backwards usually gives a more shallow depth-first recursion depth,
     adding more stack usage safety. Also, combined with the natural
     processing order of l_initfini[] at each node during DFS, this maintains
     an ordering closer to the original link ordering in the sorting results
     under most simpler cases.

     Another reason we order the top level backwards, it that maps[0] is
     usually exactly the main object of which we're in the midst of
     _dl_map_object_deps() processing, and maps[0]->l_initfini[] is still
     blank. If we start the traversal from maps[0], since having no
     dependencies yet filled in, maps[0] will always be immediately
     incorrectly placed at the last place in the order (first in reverse).
     Adjusting the order so that maps[0] is last traversed naturally avoids
     this problem.

     To summarize, just passing in the full list, and iterating from back
     to front makes things much more straightforward.  */

     The reason we do this is: while it is unspecified how circular
     dependencies should be handled, the presumed reasonable behavior is to
     have destructors to respect static dependency links as much as possible,
     overriding reldeps if needed. And the first sorting pass, which takes
     l_initfini/l_reldeps links equally, may not preserve this priority.
