/* Mappings created by dlopen can go away with dlclose, so a dynamic
   data structure with some synchronization is needed.  Individual
   segments are similar to the _dlfo_nodelete_mappings array above.
   The previous segment contains lower addresses and is at most half
   as long.  Checking the address of the base address of the first
   element during a lookup can therefore approximate a binary search
   over all segments, even though the data is not stored in one
   contiguous array.

   During updates, the segments are overwritten in place.  A software
   transactional memory construct (involving the
   _dlfo_loaded_mappings_version variable) is used to detect
   concurrent modification, and retry as necessary.  (This approach is
   similar to seqlocks, except that two copies are used, and there is
   only one writer, ever, due to the loader lock.)  Technically,
   relaxed MO loads and stores need to be used for the shared TM data,
   to avoid data races.

   The memory allocations are never deallocated, but slots used for
   objects that have been dlclose'd can be reused by dlopen.  The
   memory can live in the regular C malloc heap.

   The segments are populated from the start of the list, with the
   mappings with the highest address.  Only if this segment is full,
   previous segments are used for mappings at lower addresses.  The
   remaining segments are populated as needed, but after allocating
   further segments, some of the initial segments (at the end of the
   linked list) can be empty (with size 0).

   Adding new elements to this data structure is another source of
   quadratic behavior for dlopen.  If the other causes of quadratic
   behavior are eliminated, a more complicated data structure will be
