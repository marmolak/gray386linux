/* Multiple threads at once can use the `_dl_catch_error' function.
   The calls can come from `_dl_map_object_deps', `_dlerror_run', or
   from any of the libc functionality which loads dynamic objects
   (NSS, iconv).  Therefore we have to be prepared to save the state
   in thread-local memory.  We use THREAD_GETMEM and THREAD_SETMEM
   instead of ELF TLS because ELF TLS is not available in the dynamic
   loader.  Additionally, the exception handling mechanism must be
   usable before the TCB has been set up, which is why
   rtld_catch_notls is used if !__rtld_tls_init_tp_called.  This is
   not needed for static builds, where initialization completes before
   static dlopen etc. can be called.  */
