/* This test re-creates a situation that can arise naturally for C++
   applications due to the use of vague linkage and differences in the
   set of compiler-emitted functions.  A function in
   tst-dlclose-lazy-mod1.so (exported_function) interposes a function
   in tst-dlclose-lazy-mod2.so.  This function is called from the
   destructor in tst-dlclose-lazy-mod2.so, after the destructor for
   tst-dlclose-lazy-mod1.so has already completed.  Prior to the fix
   for bug 30425, this would lead to a lazy binding failure in
   tst-dlclose-lazy-mod1.so because dlclose had already marked the DSO
   as unavailable for binding (by setting l_removed).  */
