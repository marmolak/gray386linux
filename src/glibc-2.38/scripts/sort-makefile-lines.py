# The project consensus is to split Makefile variable assignment
# across multiple lines with one value per line.  The values are
# then sorted as described below, and terminated with a special
# list termination marker.  This splitting makes it much easier
# to add new tests to the list since they become just a single
# line insertion.  It also makes backports and merges easier
# since the new test may not conflict due to the ordering.
#

#
# To support cleaning up Makefiles we created this program to
# help sort existing lists converted to the new format.
#
# The program takes as input the Makefile to sort correctly,
# and the output file to write the correctly sorted output
# (it can be the same file).
#
# Sorting is only carried out between two special markers:
# (a) Marker start is '<variable> += \' (or '= \', or ':= \')
# (b) Marker end is '  # <variable>' (whitespace matters)
# With everything between (a) and (b) being sorted accordingly.
#
# You can use it like this:
# $ scripts/sort-makefile-lines.py < elf/Makefile > elf/Makefile.tmp
# $ mv elf/Makefile.tmp elf/Makefile
#
# The Makefile lines in the project are sorted using the
# following rules:
# - All lines are sorted as-if `LC_COLLATE=C sort`
# - Lines that have a numeric suffix and whose leading prefix
#   matches exactly are sorted according the numeric suffix
#   in increasing numerical order.
#
# For example:
# ~~~
# tests += \
#   test-a \
#   test-b \
#   test-b1 \
#   test-b2 \
#   test-b10 \
#   test-b20 \
#   test-b100 \
#   # tests
# ~~~
# This example shows tests sorted alphabetically, followed
# by a numeric suffix sort in increasing numeric order.
#
# Cleanups:
# - Tests that end in "a" or "b" variants should be renamed to
#   end in just the numerical value. For example 'tst-mutex7robust'
#   should be renamed to 'tst-mutex12' (the highest numbered test)
#   or 'tst-robust11' (the highest numbered test) in order to get
#   reasonable ordering.
# - Modules that end in "mod" or "mod1" should be renamed. For
#   example 'tst-atfork2mod' should be renamed to 'tst-mod-atfork2'
#   (test module for atfork2). If there are more than one module
#   then they should be named with a suffix that uses [0-9] first
#   then [A-Z] next for a total of 36 possible modules per test.
#   No manually listed test currently uses more than that (though
#   automatically generated tests may; they don't need sorting).
# - Avoid including another test and instead refactor into common
#   code with all tests including the common code, then give the
#   tests unique names.
#
# If you have a Makefile that needs converting, then you can
# quickly split the values into one-per-line, ensure the start
# and end markers are in place, and then run the script to
# sort the values.
