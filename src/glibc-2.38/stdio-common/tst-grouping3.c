  /* The format string has the following conversion specifier:
     '  - Use thousands grouping.
     +  - The result of a signed conversion shall begin with a sign.
     -  - Left justified.
     13 - Minimum 13 bytes of width.
     9  - Minimum 9 digits of precision.

     In bug 30068 the grouping characters were not accounted for in
     the width, and were added after the fact resulting in a 15-byte
     output instead of a 13-byte output.  The two additional bytes
     come from the locale-specific thousands separator.  This increase
     in size could result in a buffer overflow if a reasonable caller
     calculated the size of the expected buffer using nl_langinfo to
     determine the sie of THOUSEP in bytes.

     This bug is distinct from bug 23432 which has to do with the
     minimum precision calculation (digit based).  */
