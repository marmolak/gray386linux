/* <printf_buffer_as_file.h> introduces a way to use struct
   __printf_buffer objects from FILE * streams.  To avoid storing a
   function pointer (or vtable pointer) in struct __printf_buffer
   (which would defeat libio vtable hardening), a switch statement
   over the different flush implementations is used to implement
   __printf_buffer_flush.

   __printf_buffer_mode_failed is special: it is the sticky failure
   indicator.  Unlike struct alloc_buffer, this is not folded into
   write_ptr, so that snprintf and other string-writing functions can
   discover the end of the string even in the error case, to be able
   to add the null terminator.  */

     write_end, and write_ptr can be advanced accordingly.  Note that
     is not possible to use the apparently-unused part of the buffer
     as scratch space because sprintf (and snprintf, but that is a bit
     iffy) must only write the minimum number of characters produced
     by the format string and its arguments.

     write_base must be initialized to be equal to write_ptr.  The
     framework uses this pointer to compute the total number of
     written bytes, together with the written field.  See
     __printf_buffer_done.

     write_base and write_end are only read by the generic functions
     after initialization, only the flush implementation called from
