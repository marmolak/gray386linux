/* The hwcap and platform strings are now in

/* Needed by sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/dl-vdso-setup.c (as included from

/* All the #ifdefs in the definitions are quite irritating but
   necessary if we want to avoid duplicating the information.  There
   are three different modes:

   - PROCINFO_DECL is defined.  This means we are only interested in
     declarations.

   - PROCINFO_DECL is not defined:

     + if SHARED is defined the file is included in an array
       initializer.  The .element = { ... } syntax is needed.

     + if SHARED is not defined a normal array initialization is
       needed.
