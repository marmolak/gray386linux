/* The compiler might optimize loops or other constructs to library calls even
   in freestanding mode.  Although it is safe in most scenarios, on program
   loading and static startup, iFUNC resolution might require other dynamic
   relocation that are not yet done.

   Instead of adding per-file compiler flags to avoid the libcall generation,
   this header defines generic symbols that will be routed instead of the
   default symbols name.

   Each port can then make the required redirection to the expected generic
   implementation if the symbol is provided as iFUNC, with a global definition
   such as:

     asm ("memset = __memset_generic");
