/* Depending on the details of the glibc configuration, fma might use
   either SSE or 387 arithmetic; ensure that both parts of the
   floating-point state are handled in the round-to-odd code.  If
   __FP_FAST_FMA is defined, that implies that the compiler is using
   SSE floating point and that the fma call will be inlined, so the
   x86 macros will work with only the SSE state and that is
   sufficient.  */
