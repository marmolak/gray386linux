/**
 * DOC: Transport layer - what is it ?
 *
 * The tranport layer is the layer that deals with the HW directly. It provides
 * an abstraction of the underlying HW to the upper layer. The transport layer
 * doesn't provide any policy, algorithm or anything of this kind, but only
 * mechanisms to make the HW do something.It is not completely stateless but
 * close to it.
 * We will have an implementation for each different supported bus.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Life cycle of the transport layer
 *
 * The transport layer has a very precise life cycle.
 *
 *	1) A helper function is called during the module initialization and
 *	   registers the bus driver's ops with the transport's alloc function.
 *	2) Bus's probe calls to the transport layer's allocation functions.
 *	   Of course this function is bus specific.
 *	3) This allocation functions will spawn the upper layer which will
 *	   register mac80211.
 *
 *	4) At some point (i.e. mac80211's start call), the op_mode will call
 *	   the following sequence:
 *	   start_hw
 *	   start_fw
 *
 *	5) Then when finished (or reset):
 *	   stop_fw (a.k.a. stop device for the moment)
 *	   stop_hw
 *
 *	6) Eventually, the free function will be called.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Host command section
 *
 * A host command is a commaned issued by the upper layer to the fw. There are
 * several versions of fw that have several APIs. The transport layer is
 * completely agnostic to these differences.
 * The transport does provide helper functionnality (i.e. SYNC / ASYNC mode),
