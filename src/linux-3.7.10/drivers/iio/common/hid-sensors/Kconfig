	  Say yes here to build support for HID sensor to use
	  HID sensor common processing for attributes and IIO triggers.
	  There are many attributes which can be shared among multiple
	  HID sensor drivers, this module contains processing for those
	  attributes.

	depends on HID_SENSOR_IIO_COMMON
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for sensor hub FW using
	  enumeration, which is using 1 as base instead of 0.
	  Since logical minimum is still set 0 instead of 1,
	  there is no easy way to differentiate.
