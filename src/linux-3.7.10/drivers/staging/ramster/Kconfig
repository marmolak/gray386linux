	  Zcache2 doubles RAM efficiency while providing a significant
	  performance boosts on many workloads.  Zcache2 uses
	  compression and an in-kernel implementation of transcendent
	  memory to store clean page cache pages and swap in RAM,
	  providing a noticeable reduction in disk I/O.  Zcache2
	  is a complete rewrite of the older zcache; it was intended to
	  be a merge but that has been blocked due to political and
	  technical disagreements.  It is intended that they will merge
	  again in the future.  Until then, zcache2 is a single-node
	  version of ramster.

	  RAMster allows RAM on other machines in a cluster to be utilized
	  dynamically and symmetrically instead of swapping to a local swap
	  disk, thus improving performance on memory-constrained workloads
	  while minimizing total RAM across the cluster.  RAMster, like
	  zcache2, compresses swap pages into local RAM, but then remotifies
	  the compressed pages to another node in the RAMster cluster.
