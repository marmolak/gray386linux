	  If you say yes here you get support for the Texas Instruments
	  OMAP4460+ on die bandgap temperature sensor support. The register
	  set is part of system control module.

	  This includes alert interrupts generation and also the TSHUT
	  support.

	help
	  If you say yes here you get thermal support for the Texas Instruments
	  OMAP4 SoC family. The current chip supported are:
	   - OMAP4430
	   - OMAP4460
	   - OMAP4470

	  This includes alert interrupts generation and also the TSHUT
	  support.
