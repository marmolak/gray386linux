	  NXP PN544 i2c driver.
	  This is a driver based on the SHDLC and HCI NFC kernel layers and
	  will thus not work with NXP libnfc library.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose m here. The module will
	  be called pn544_hci.

	  NXP PN533 USB driver.
	  This driver provides support for NFC NXP PN533 devices.

	  Say Y here to compile support for PN533 devices into the
	  kernel or say M to compile it as module (pn533).

	  This enables the NFC driver for Texas Instrument's BT/FM/GPS/NFC
	  combo devices. This makes use of shared transport line discipline
	  core driver to communicate with the NFC core of the combo chip.

	  Say Y here to compile support for Texas Instrument's NFC WiLink driver
	  into the kernel or say M to compile it as module.
