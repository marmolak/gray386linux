Cirrus Logic CS4271 DT bindings

This driver supports both the I2C and the SPI bus.

Required properties:

 - compatible: "cirrus,cs4271"

For required properties on SPI, please consult
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt

Required properties on I2C:

 - reg: the i2c address


Optional properties:

 - reset-gpio: 	a GPIO spec to define which pin is connected to the chip's
		!RESET pin

Examples:

	codec_i2c: cs4271@10 {
		compatible = "cirrus,cs4271";
		reg = <0x10>;
		reset-gpio = <&gpio 23 0>;
	};

	codec_spi: cs4271@0 {
		compatible = "cirrus,cs4271";
		reg = <0x0>;
		reset-gpio = <&gpio 23 0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <6000000>;
	};
