* ARM Primecell Peripherals

ARM, Ltd. Primecell peripherals have a standard id register that can be used to
identify the peripheral type, vendor, and revision. This value can be used for
driver matching.

Required properties:

- compatible : should be a specific name for the peripheral and
               "arm,primecell".  The specific name will match the ARM
               engineering name for the logic block in the form: "arm,pl???"

Optional properties:

- arm,primecell-periphid : Value to override the h/w value with
- clocks : From common clock binding. First clock is phandle to clock for apb
	pclk. Additional clocks are optional and specific to those peripherals.
- clock-names : From common clock binding. Shall be "apb_pclk" for first clock.

Example:

serial@fff36000 {
	compatible = "arm,pl011", "arm,primecell";
	arm,primecell-periphid = <0x00341011>;
	clocks = <&pclk>;
	clock-names = "apb_pclk";
	
};
