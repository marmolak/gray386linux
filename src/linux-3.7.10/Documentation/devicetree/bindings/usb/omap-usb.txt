OMAP MUSB GLUE
 - compatible : Should be "ti,omap4-musb" or "ti,omap3-musb"
 - ti,hwmods : must be "usb_otg_hs"
 - multipoint : Should be "1" indicating the musb controller supports
   multipoint. This is a MUSB configuration-specific setting.
 - num_eps : Specifies the number of endpoints. This is also a
   MUSB configuration-specific setting. Should be set to "16"
 - ram_bits : Specifies the ram address size. Should be set to "12"
 - interface_type : This is a board specific setting to describe the type of
   interface between the controller and the phy. It should be "0" or "1"
   specifying ULPI and UTMI respectively.
 - mode : Should be "3" to represent OTG. "1" signifies HOST and "2"
   represents PERIPHERAL.
 - power : Should be "50". This signifies the controller can supply upto
   100mA when operating in host mode.
