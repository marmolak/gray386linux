* Samsung's SDHCI Controller device tree bindings

Samsung's SDHCI controller is used as a connectivity interface with external
MMC, SD and eMMC storage mediums. This file documents differences between the
core mmc properties described by mmc.txt and the properties used by the
Samsung implmentation of the SDHCI controller.

Note: The mmc core bindings documentation states that if none of the core
card-detect bindings are used, then the standard sdhci card detect mechanism
is used. The Samsung's SDHCI controller bindings extends this as listed below.

[A] The property "samsung,cd-pinmux-gpio" can be used as stated in the
    "Optional Board Specific Properties" section below.

[B] If core card-detect bindings and "samsung,cd-pinmux-gpio" property
    is not specified, it is assumed that there is no card detection
    mechanism used.

Required SoC Specific Properties:
- compatible: should be one of the following
  - "samsung,s3c6410-sdhci": For controllers compatible with s3c6410 sdhci
    controller.
  - "samsung,exynos4210-sdhci": For controllers compatible with Exynos4 sdhci
    controller.

Required Board Specific Properties:
- gpios: Should specify the gpios used for clock, command and data lines. The
  gpio specifier format depends on the gpio controller.

Optional Board Specific Properties:
- samsung,cd-pinmux-gpio: Specifies the card detect line that is routed
  through a pinmux to the card-detect pin of the card slot. This property
  should be used only if none of the mmc core card-detect properties are
  used.

Example:
	sdhci@12530000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-sdhci";
		reg = <0x12530000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <0 75 0>;
		bus-width = <4>;
		cd-gpios = <&gpk2 2 2 3 3>;
		gpios = <&gpk2 0 2 0 3>,  /* clock line */
			<&gpk2 1 2 0 3>,  /* command line */
			<&gpk2 3 2 3 3>,  /* data line 0 */
			<&gpk2 4 2 3 3>,  /* data line 1 */
			<&gpk2 5 2 3 3>,  /* data line 2 */
			<&gpk2 6 2 3 3>;  /* data line 3 */
	};

	Note: This example shows both SoC specific and board specific properties
	in a single device node. The properties can be actually be seperated
	into SoC specific node and board specific node.
