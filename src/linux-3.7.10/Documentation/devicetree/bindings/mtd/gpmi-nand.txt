* Freescale General-Purpose Media Interface (GPMI)

The GPMI nand controller provides an interface to control the
NAND flash chips. We support only one NAND chip now.

Required properties:
  - compatible : should be "fsl,<chip>-gpmi-nand"
  - reg : should contain registers location and length for gpmi and bch.
  - reg-names: Should contain the reg names "gpmi-nand" and "bch"
  - interrupts : The first is the DMA interrupt number for GPMI.
                 The second is the BCH interrupt number.
  - interrupt-names : The interrupt names "gpmi-dma", "bch";
  - fsl,gpmi-dma-channel : Should contain the dma channel it uses.

Optional properties:
  - nand-on-flash-bbt: boolean to enable on flash bbt option if not
                       present false

The device tree may optionally contain sub-nodes describing partitions of the
address space. See partition.txt for more detail.

Examples:

gpmi-nand@8000c000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx28-gpmi-nand";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	reg = <0x8000c000 2000>, <0x8000a000 2000>;
	reg-names = "gpmi-nand", "bch";
	interrupts = <88>, <41>;
	interrupt-names = "gpmi-dma", "bch";
	fsl,gpmi-dma-channel = <4>;

	partition@0 {
	...
	};
};
