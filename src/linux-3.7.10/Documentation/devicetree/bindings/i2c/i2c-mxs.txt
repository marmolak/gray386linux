* Freescale MXS Inter IC (I2C) Controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "fsl,<chip>-i2c"
- reg: Should contain registers location and length
- interrupts: Should contain ERROR and DMA interrupts
- clock-frequency: Desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz.
                   Only 100000Hz and 400000Hz modes are supported.
- fsl,i2c-dma-channel: APBX DMA channel for the I2C

Examples:

i2c0: i2c@80058000 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "fsl,imx28-i2c";
	reg = <0x80058000 2000>;
	interrupts = <111 68>;
	clock-frequency = <100000>;
	fsl,i2c-dma-channel = <6>;
};
