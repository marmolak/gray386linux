/**
 * struct clk_ops -  Callback operations for hardware clocks; these are to
 * be provided by the clock implementation, and will be called by drivers
 * through the clk_* api.
 *
 * @prepare:	Prepare the clock for enabling. This must not return until
 * 		the clock is fully prepared, and it's safe to call clk_enable.
 * 		This callback is intended to allow clock implementations to
 * 		do any initialisation that may sleep. Called with
 * 		prepare_lock held.
 *
 * @unprepare:	Release the clock from its prepared state. This will typically
 * 		undo any work done in the @prepare callback. Called with
 * 		prepare_lock held.
 *
 * @enable:	Enable the clock atomically. This must not return until the
 * 		clock is generating a valid clock signal, usable by consumer
 * 		devices. Called with enable_lock held. This function must not
 * 		sleep.
 *
 * @disable:	Disable the clock atomically. Called with enable_lock held.
 * 		This function must not sleep.
 *
 * @recalc_rate	Recalculate the rate of this clock, by quering hardware.  The
 * 		parent rate is an input parameter.  It is up to the caller to
 * 		insure that the prepare_mutex is held across this call.
 * 		Returns the calculated rate.  Optional, but recommended - if
 * 		this op is not set then clock rate will be initialized to 0.
 *
 * @round_rate:	Given a target rate as input, returns the closest rate actually
 * 		supported by the clock.
 *
 * @get_parent:	Queries the hardware to determine the parent of a clock.  The
 * 		return value is a u8 which specifies the index corresponding to
 * 		the parent clock.  This index can be applied to either the
 * 		.parent_names or .parents arrays.  In short, this function
 * 		translates the parent value read from hardware into an array
 * 		index.  Currently only called when the clock is initialized by
 * 		__clk_init.  This callback is mandatory for clocks with
 * 		multiple parents.  It is optional (and unnecessary) for clocks
 * 		with 0 or 1 parents.
 *
 * @set_parent:	Change the input source of this clock; for clocks with multiple
 * 		possible parents specify a new parent by passing in the index
 * 		as a u8 corresponding to the parent in either the .parent_names
 * 		or .parents arrays.  This function in affect translates an
 * 		array index into the value programmed into the hardware.
 * 		Returns 0 on success, -EERROR otherwise.
 *
 * @set_rate:	Change the rate of this clock. The requested rate is specified
 *		by the second argument, which should typically be the return
 *		of .round_rate call.  The third argument gives the parent rate
 *		which is likely helpful for most .set_rate implementation.
 *		Returns 0 on success, -EERROR otherwise.
 *
 * The clk_enable/clk_disable and clk_prepare/clk_unprepare pairs allow
 * implementations to split any work between atomic (enable) and sleepable
 * (prepare) contexts.  If enabling a clock requires code that might sleep,
 * this must be done in clk_prepare.  Clock enable code that will never be
 * called in a sleepable context may be implement in clk_enable.
 *
 * Typically, drivers will call clk_prepare when a clock may be needed later
 * (eg. when a device is opened), and clk_enable when the clock is actually
 * required (eg. from an interrupt). Note that clk_prepare MUST have been
 * called before clk_enable.
