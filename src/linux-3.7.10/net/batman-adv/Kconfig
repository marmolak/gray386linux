          B.A.T.M.A.N. (better approach to mobile ad-hoc networking) is
          a routing protocol for multi-hop ad-hoc mesh networks. The
          networks may be wired or wireless. See
          http://www.open-mesh.org/ for more information and user space
          tools.

config BATMAN_ADV_BLA

	depends on BATMAN_ADV && INET
	default y
	help
	  This option enables BLA (Bridge Loop Avoidance), a mechanism
	  to avoid Ethernet frames looping when mesh nodes are connected
	  to both the same LAN and the same mesh. If you will never use
	  more than one mesh node in the same LAN, you can safely remove
	  this feature and save some space.

config BATMAN_ADV_DEBUG
	bool "B.A.T.M.A.N. debugging"
	depends on BATMAN_ADV
	help
	  This is an option for use by developers; most people should
	  say N here. This enables compilation of support for
	  outputting debugging information to the kernel log. The
	  output is controlled via the module parameter debug.
